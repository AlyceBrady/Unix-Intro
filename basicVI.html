Vi is a visual editor commonly available on UNIX machines.  If you are
new to vi, you may want to see if vim is available on the machine(s) you
are using.  Vim is "vi improved" and provides syntax coloring (very
helpful) and some other neat features.

Here are two email messages Alyce wrote to Autumn Spaulding when she was
studying abroad in Australia and had to use vi for the first time.  They
have not been cleaned up, formatted, or otherwise updated, but they
contain basic information that may be useful to other students starting
out with this common editor.
