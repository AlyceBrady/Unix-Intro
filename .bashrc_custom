# ~/.bashrc_custom: if executed by bash, reads in customized aliases and
#                   environment variables
#
# USAGE:  add the following lines to the bottom of your .bashrc file:
#   if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc_custom ]; then
#       . $HOME/.bashrc_custom;
#   fi
#
#  To define custom aliases or environment variables that work under
#  any flavor of *nix, define them in ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.env_vars,
#  then make sure you are executing them or this file from your .bashrc.
#  If you have some aliases or environment variables that are specific
#  to a particular flavor, put them in ~/.bash_aliases-darwin or
#  ~/.bash_aliases-linux (or .env_vars-darwin, .env_vars-linux).
#  The .git-completion.bash file comes from the Git source.
