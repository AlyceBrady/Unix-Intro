Here are a few more vi tricks that will help you become faster at
editing files.  Pick out a few at a time to learn and use.

  - J (note capital) "joins" this line and the next, i.e. gets rid of
        newline between them  -- this is the way to "delete" a newline
  - Finding text:  use /  -- e.g. /text would find the next occurence of
        "text" after the cursor (like command-F on a Mac or control-F on 
        a PC); use ? to search backwards
        shortcuts: n    finds the "next" occurence of the same thing
                        in the same direction (like command/control-G)
                   N    finds the next occurence thing in the
                        opposite direction
  - The period repeats the last text-modification command (not cursor
        movement) at the current cursor position
                Hint: use with n, for example:
                        /Alice          find misspelling
                        cwAlyce<esc>    fix it (see below for cw command)
                        n               find next Alice
                        .               change it also
                        n.n.n.          make the change in three more places
  - You can "repeat" commands by putting a number in front of them.
        e.g., 3x would delete 3 characters; 3dd would delete 3 lines.
  - If you have autoindent turned on in vi, use control-d at the beginning
        of the line to back out of indentation you don't want.
        (In vim you can use backspace.)
  - Other ways to get into insert mode: o will "open" line(s) below the
        cursor and O (capital o) will open line(s) above the cursor;
        I (capital i) will start inserting at the beginning of the
        line and A will append at the end of the line.  (You don't have
        to move the cursor there separately.)
  - Copy and paste is "yank" and "put":  3yy will copy 3 lines to the
        "clipboard" and p will put them below the current line.  Deletion
        also copies to the "clipboard", so 3dd will delete 3 lines
        and p will put the 3 deleted lines below the current line.
        (Obviously you usually want to move the cursor after you do the
        yy or dd so that you put the copied or deleted text somewhere else.)
        If you didn't yank or delete full lines (e.g., dw will delete to
        the end of the word), then p puts text after the cursor in the
        same line.  P (note capital P!) puts text before the cursor or
        before the current line, depending on whether the text is only
        part of a line or whole lines.  Be careful to note that some
        other commands use the clipboard also, so you shouldn't do
        anthing between the y/d and the p except move the cursor!!!
  - Handy cursor movement commands:
        w       next word (where a word is made up of letters, digits,
                and underscores - the same things allowed in C variables)
        W       next white-space-separated word  (e.g., if cursor were
                on the w in white-space-separated, w would jump to the
                first hyphen and W would jump to the word "word")
        b       beginning of this word (or prev. word if cursor is already
                at beginning of this word)
        B       beginning of white-space-separated word
        e       end of word
        E       end of white-space-separated word (notice a pattern?)
        + or return     go to first character in next line
        -       go to first character in prev. line
        0       go to absolute beginning of this line
        $       go to end of this line
  - You can use these (and other) cursor movement commands with the y,
        d, and c (change/replace) commands, e.g.,
                3yw     yank (copy) 3 words
                d$      delete from cursor to end of line
                ce      change from here to end of word (note: c puts
                        you in insert mode, so it's ceabc<ESC> if you
                        want to change it to abc.
        You can repeat the y, d, and c commands to refer to a whole line:
                yy      yanks the whole line (even if cursor isn't at the
                        beginning of the line)
                3dd     deletes 3 lines
        Capitalize c and d to mean "from cursor to end of line":
                C       change from here to end of line
                D       delete from cursor to end of line
                Y       different! -- acts like yy
  - Fast scrolling:
        1G      move to first line in file
        nG      move to line n
        G       move to last line in file
        ctl-d   scroll down half a window
        ctl-u   scroll up half a window
        ctl-f   scroll forward (down) a whole window
        ctl-b   scroll back (up) a whole window
        H       jump cursor to first line showing in window ("home" line)
        M       jump cursor to "middle" line showing in window
        L       jump cursor to "last" line showing in window
  - Seeing more context:
        ctl-e   show one more line at bottom of window without moving cursor
        ctl-y   show one more line at top of window without moving cursor
