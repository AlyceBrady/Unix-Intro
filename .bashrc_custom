# ~/.bashrc_custom: if executed by bash, reads in customized aliases and
#                   environment variables
#
# To execute automatically every time you start a new interactive shell,
# run the customize_bashrc script, which will update your .bashrc file.
# You need only do this once.  Then re-execute your .bashrc file:
#    source ~/.bashrc
#
#  To customize environment variables, put them in ~/.env_vars and
#  then make sure you are running either .env_vars or .customize_bashrc
#  from your .bashrc file.  To define custom aliases or environment
#  variables that work under any flavor of *nix, then define them in
#  ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.env_vars.  If you have some that are specific
#  to a particular flavor, put them in ~/.bash_aliases-darwin or
#  ~/.bash_aliases-linux (or .env_vars-darwin, .env_vars-linux).
#  The .git-completion.bash file comes from the Git source.
