Most of the following can be found at this great page:
http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion

Start up http server: sudo apachectl start

Make sure that the /etc/apache2/users directory contains a file
called abrady.conf, whose contents should be:

<Directory "/Users/abrady/Sites/">
Options FollowSymLinks Indexes MultiViews
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

In /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, 
  *  Make sure that AllowOveride within
     <Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents"> is All (not None).
  *  Uncomment LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
  => Uncomment the Include for httpd-vhosts.conf (not in coolestguy's page)

Download the latest version of mysql:  
  *  Use mysql -V to see current version
  => Shut down the current version BEFORE installing next version !!!!
  *  Download next version (I've done it using macports, but downloaded 5.6
     from mysql web site as dmg file & then installed that)
  *  Either setup the new database (set root password using
     mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpasswordhere', and create accounts
     and databases as necessary) or copy / import previous data into new db
     (e.g., cp -pR /usr/local/old-mysql-ver/data /usr/local/mysql/data)

Make sure that php.ini has the following:
  All:
    appropriate extension_dir (e.g.,
        "/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626")
    appropriate zend_extension (e.g.,
        "/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/xdebug.so")
  Development machines only:
    error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT
    display_errors = On
    display_startup_errors = On
    html_errors = On
  Is pear necessary?  I'm not sure.  Might be needed for phpunit34.
    If so, install, which will cause include_path in php.ini to be changed.
  Also had to set short_open_tag to On.  Finally, I set date.timezone to
    UTC ((local time zone for the server).


Ramp/Smart Setup:
=================

Add the following lines to /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1       zf-tutorial.localhost
# 127.0.0.1       ramp.localhost
127.0.0.1       smart
127.0.0.1       ramp.development
127.0.0.1       ramp.demo
127.0.0.1       smart.demo
127.0.0.1       exp
127.0.0.1       njala.development

Update the /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file, then do an
apachectl restart.  Add lines like following:

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName localhost
   DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName smart
   DocumentRoot "/Users/abrady/WebApplications/Ramp/public"

   # This should be omitted in the production environment (Really?)
   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV production

   <Directory "/Users/abrady/WebApplications/Ramp/public">
       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride All
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
   </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

Add other paragraphs like that for ServerName smart, with different
environments, e.g.,
   ServerName ramp.development: SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development
   ServerName smart.test: SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV testing
   ServerName ramp.demo: SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV rampdemo
   ServerName smart.demo: SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV smartdemo
   ServerName njala.development: SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV njala
