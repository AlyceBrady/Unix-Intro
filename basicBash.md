## Very Basic <code>bash</code>

If you are logged into a terminal window on a Unix/Linux/OS X machine,
you are interacting with an application called a "shell" (called this
because it serves as the outer shell of the operating system).  There
are several shell programs out there, including <code>sh</code>,
<code>csh</code>, <code>tcsh</code>, and <code>bash</code>.  You can
find out which one is running by typing <code>echo $0</code> at the
terminal prompt.

<code>bash</code> is perhaps the most common shell these days.  It has
most of the features of other shells.  In particular, you can use
the up arrow to see previous commands and use the left arrow and 
back space keys to edit them.  Another nice feature is file name
completion; if you type a tab after typing just enough of a file name
to uniquely identify it, the shell will complete the file name for
you.  If you have not uniquely identified it, it will complete as much
as it can and then you can hit the tab
key again to see a list of the files that match the substring you have
typed in.  You can look at the <code>bash</code> manual page for many
more details about if you are interested.

If you are new to UNIX, you may want to look at the
[basicUNIX](#basicUNIX) document.
One of the most useful commands listed there is the <code>exit</code>
command, which you can use to log out.

If you are interested in learning <code>vi</code>, you may want to look at
the [basicVI](#basicVI) document.
