#
#  "bash" is the name of your UNIX command interpreter, or "shell".
#  This file contains bash commands which are run every time a new
#  shell begins.
#
#  The order in which files are executed is:
#       /etc/profile, which executes
#       /etc/bash.bashrc
#       $HOME/.profile, which executes
#       $HOME/.bashrc
#
#  On some systems, the default .bashrc runs .bash_aliases if it
#  exists.  
#
#  If you want to customize some environment variables, you could put
#  them in ~/.env_vars and then source that from the end of .bashrc.
#  If you want to define some custom aliases or environment variables
#  that work under any flavor of *nix, then define them in
#  ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.env_vars.  If you have some that are specific
#  to a particular flavor, put them in ~/.bash_aliases-darwin or
#  ~/.bash_aliases-linux (or .env_vars-darwin, .env_vars-linux).
#  The .git-completion.bash file comes from the Git source.
